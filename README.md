# ðŸŒ¿  LUMORA â€“ Your Personalized Mental Health Companion

LUMORA is a mental health care app made to help users manage their emotions and well-being.  
It offers a simple and personalized way to improve mental health with easy-to-use features, healthy content, and interactive tools.

The app uses soft, neutral and pastel colors to create a calm and welcoming feel. These colors were chosen because they help reduce stress, promote relaxation, and bring emotional balance. The gentle tones make the app easy on the eyes, helping users feel comfortable.
